# api-final

Api-final project is based on a crypto currency api idea. Users, exchanges, tokens, blockchains, and crypto wallets can be created through the API. A record from any of the crypto entities can be deleted, however some have order-rules that must be followed based on the relationships that some entities have with each other. The api also allows to get a list of any of the entities, and the isMiner trait of a user can be updated throuhg an update method.

If there are errors with accessing the database, please see directory api-final/main/resources/sqlqueries where you can then run the query to make the crypto database as well as the accompanying query to populate the database.
